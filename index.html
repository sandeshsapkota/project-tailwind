            <p> Mosh is one of Australia’s leading online mens’ health clinics. Based in Sydney’s Bondi, they provide men with virtual consultations led by healthcare experts on issues such as sexual health and hair loss. Ahead of expanding their offering to skincare and mental health in 2020, they approached us for a brand refresh.

                Any insights?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Mosh found in their research that people, men especially, take comfort from editorial publications — they have inherent trust, integrity and authority. Given the brand deals with sensitive subject matters for men (who often need a little extra encouragement to seek health help anyway), building trust and being informative without feeling belittling was key.
